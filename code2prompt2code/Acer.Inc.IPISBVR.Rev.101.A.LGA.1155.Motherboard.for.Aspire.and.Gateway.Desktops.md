However, this motherboard has some limitations when it comes to upgrading the CPU. According to some users, it does not support Ivy Bridge processors, which are the 22nm version of Sandy Bridge processors that use the same socket. To use an Ivy Bridge CPU, such as i7 3770, the motherboard needs a BIOS update to P03-A3 or P11-A3. However, these BIOS versions are not compatible with this motherboard and will cause an error message when trying to flash them[^1^] [^3^]. Therefore, users who want to upgrade their CPU should stick to Sandy Bridge processors, such as i7 2600 or 2700[^1^]. Alternatively, they can look for a different motherboard that has updated BIOS and Ivy Bridge support.
 
Acer Inc IPISB-VR Rev 1.01 is a decent motherboard for its time, but it may not meet the needs of users who want to use newer processors or have more expansion options. It is also hard to find technical support or documentation for this motherboard, as it is an OEM product that was not sold separately. Users who have this motherboard should be careful when upgrading their hardware and software, and check the compatibility before making any changes.
  
If you are looking for a review of Acer Inc IPISB-VR Rev 1.01 motherboard, you may not find many online sources. This motherboard is not a popular or widely available product, as it was designed for specific desktop models by Acer and Gateway. However, some users have shared their experiences and opinions about this motherboard on various forums and websites[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. Here are some of the pros and cons of this motherboard based on user feedback:
 
- **Pros:**
    - It supports a range of LGA 1155 processors, from i3 to i7, and offers good performance for everyday tasks and gaming[^1^] [^2^].
    - It has four memory slots that can support up to 16GB of DDR3 RAM[^2^].
    - It has integrated graphics, audio and ethernet that work well with Windows 10[^2^] [^3^].
    - It has a HDMI port that can output high-definition video and audio to a monitor or TV[^2^] [^3^].
- **Cons:**
    - It does not support Ivy Bridge processors, which are newer and more efficient than Sandy Bridge processors. To use an Ivy Bridge CPU, you need to update the BIOS, but the available BIOS versions are not compatible with this motherboard[^1^] [^3^].
    - It has only one PCI Express x16 slot, which limits the options for adding a discrete graphics card or other expansion cards[^2^].
    - It has only six SATA II ports, which are slower than SATA III ports and may not be enough for connecting multiple hard drives or optical drives[^2^].
    - It does not have USB 3.0 ports, which are faster and more convenient than USB 2.0 ports. Some models may have a USB 3.0 header, but you need to buy a separate bracket to use it[^2^].

In conclusion, Acer Inc IPISB-VR Rev 1.01 is a decent motherboard for its time, but it may not meet the needs of users who want to use newer processors or have more expansion options. It is also hard to find technical support or documentation for this motherboard, as it is an OEM product that was not sold separately. Users who have this motherboard should be careful when upgrading their hardware and software, and check the compatibility before making any changes.
