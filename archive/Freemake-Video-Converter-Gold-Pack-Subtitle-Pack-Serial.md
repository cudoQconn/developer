## Freemake Video Converter Gold Pack Subtitle Pack Serial

  
I followed the instructions on the website and clicked on the Download Now Button to get the freemake converter software, Gold or Subtitle Pack as well as Serial No. However, what I got instead was an ie file that did not contain any of these products. When I opened the ie file, it only displayed the same website that I had visited before. I was confused and frustrated by this. Where can I find the key for the Gold Pack that I wanted to download?
